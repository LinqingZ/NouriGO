                Our company prioritizes solving the obesity health crisis that affects New Yorkers.  In inner city neighborhoods especially, it is difficult to get healthy food options. According to NYC health, in New York City obesity is an epidemic. More than half of adult New Yorkers are overweight (34%) or obese (22%). There are short term and long term ramifications towards the unhealthy food options that are solely available to certain demographics.

                According to the CDC, “Perceived barriers to fruit and vegetable consumption include cost, as well as limited availability and access (6–8). For some persons, such barriers might have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, related to economic and supply chain disruptions that could further limit ability to access healthier foods (9).” While implementing new stores that offer healthy foods is a prospective solution, it can cause further food insecurity due to these stores typically being highly priced for the community's income. Other solutions to this issue are also too far away from the community, forcing people to travel farther to get healthy food options.

                NouriGO makes healthy and affordable food far more accessible compared to other brick and mortar locations customers would have to travel to. Our company would be in locations like CUNY college campuses and low income neighborhoods where there is a demand for healthy well-priced food options but is unavailable. The CDC states prospective solutions that NouriGO can achieve. The CDC website says,  “Tailored intervention efforts to increase fruit and vegetable intake are needed to reduce age, sex, racial/ethnic, and income disparities in meeting fruit and vegetable intake recommendations among U.S. adults. States and communities can take actions by supporting food policy councils (community-based coalitions often supporting a specific community such as households with incomes below the federal poverty level or persons from racial and ethnic minority groups) to build a more sustainable food system, supporting community retail programs to attract grocery stores and supermarkets to underserved communities to improve community food quality and increase healthy food access…” The NouriGO food truck achieves this by bringing healthy foods to the communities that need it, while allowing the community to keep the stores and structures already established there.
